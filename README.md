# What? Why? ðŸ“„

So you've built your website using X framework.
And you want to share it with your friends!
You've probably seen many cloud services 
that provide you with a way to host your site for free - 
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), 
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/),
[Surge](https://surge.sh/)
or even [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)!

Even though *some options are free*,
others *aren't*.
Regardless,
using has many advantages 
and it's **extremely practical**
if you're already developing your website 
on this platform.

So why should you use Github Pages?
It's a great way to communicate
with **like-minded** by showcasing your projects,
thus contributing to the **Open-Source community**.

- **It's free**. This goes without explanation.

- **Custom domain support**. 
By default, sites deployed on Github Pages 
are deployed to `https://<your_account_name>.github.io/<repo_name>`.
But you can *buy* a domain for yourself
and [use it for yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)!

- **HTTPS support**. 
If you've ever deployed a website on-premises,
you may know that getting a certificate
so your website runs on HTTPS
is a *cumbersome process*.
With Github Pages, 
you can enforce HTTPS 
with a click of a button!

</p>

- **It's seamless**.
By setting up a simple 
[Github Action pipeline](https://github.com/features/actions),
you can have your CI being deployed automatically!

- **`Jekyll` automatically supported**.
[`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/)
is a Ruby-based site generator 
which will create HTML and serve our files for us.
